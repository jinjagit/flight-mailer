Note: This project adds to my [flight-booker app](https://github.com/jinjagit/flight-booker) (A.K.A. 'Dream Flights')

[View in browser](https://dream-flights-simontharby.herokuapp.com/) \*The server for this app may need to initialize and this may take up to 30 seconds.

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
